# Solid-CLI

This is my attempt at a CLI for creating Solidjs and SolidStart projects by using just a few commands. This is just a light project that I came up with while exploring [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). I might decided to or not to build on this further but for anyone interested feel free to fork and build upon this.

## Install and Run

```bash
npm install
node index.js
```
